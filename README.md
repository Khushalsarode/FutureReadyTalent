  ## Units Conversion Site
      *Units Conversion web application is well-designed and user-friendly!*
 
### About
The Units Conversion web application is a simple yet useful tool that allows users to quickly and easily convert units from one type to another. With support for      length, weight, currency, and temperature conversions, users can input values and instantly see the converted result. 

### Validation
The Units Conversion web application has validation rules to ensure users enter accurate values. Negative values are not allowed for currency, weight, or length, and only Kelvin can take non-negative values in temperature. If users enter an invalid value, a prompt appears. This maintains application integrity and ensures accurate results.

To ensure the accuracy of currency conversions, the Units Conversion web application fetches currency values from the internet. This allows the application to use up-to-date currency values and provide users with accurate results. By using live data, users can be confident that they are receiving the most accurate currency conversions possible.
